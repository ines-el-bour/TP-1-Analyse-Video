# TP1-Analyse-Video
This repository contains the code and notebooks developed for TP1 – Video Analysis.
The goal is to segment and detect moving objects in a video captured with a stationary camera.

The analyzed video contains:

-A hand gesture (peace sign)

-Opening a water bottle

-Drinking action

The project explores several spatial and temporal segmentation methods, as well as OpenCV’s built-in background subtraction techniques.
